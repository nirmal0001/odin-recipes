    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This creamy Chicken Alfredo is a comforting dish with tender chicken breasts, a rich, velvety Alfredo sauce, and perfectly cooked fettuccine. It's a family favorite that is both filling and flavorful.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts, boneless and skinless</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat and cook chicken for 5-7 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, melt butter and stir in heavy cream. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in grated Parmesan cheese and garlic powder, and cook until the sauce thickens, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook fettuccine according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
